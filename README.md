In this project I simulate an A/B Test using an e-commerce website dataset provided by Udacity. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?select=ab_data.csv).

This project was set up following the premises of [Reproducible Research](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research), so that anyone can achieve the same results as me using the steps I followed in Jupyter Notebook.

# Project libraries


All dependencies can be found in the file  `requirements.txt`, but are also listed below:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

To install the dependencies run in the project's main folder : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

To access the Jupyter Notebook that I created, run in the root folder of the `jupyter notebook` project. Soon after, your browser will open and just select the file `SHAP - Automobile Data Set.ipynb`.  

# Project structure

```{sh}
  .
  |-report
  |  |- A-B Test.md
  |- data
  |- A-B Test.ipynb
  |- requirements.txt
```

The folder `report` contains a md file with a version of the report generated from the study done on that project. This file contains **all the insights and studies that were done, as well as a detailed description of how the project was developed**.

**All references used to create this project are described in the report**.
